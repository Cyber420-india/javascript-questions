# Theory

1 Why do we use **functions** in **JavaScript**?
>>if we want to do a particular taks sevral times in a program then we need to use that particular block of code every time that will increase our code size. so overcoming from this problem we use function

2 What is Function **Invocation**?
>>JavaScript Function Invocation is used to executes the function code and it is common to use the term “call a function” instead of “invoke a function”. The code inside a function is executed when the function is invoked

3 Does a function behave like an object in Javascript? Prove it by an example.
>> yes in javascript function behave like objects.because like objects they have methods and properties and they can stored in a variable or an array and can be passed as an argument to another function
```
 function greet(){
     console.log("good morning");
 }
 
 console.log(typeof greet); //function
 console.log(greet instanceof Object); //true
```

4 What are Events in Javascript?
>>JavaScript's interaction with HTML is handled through events that occur when the user or the browser manipulates a page. When the page loads, it is called an event. When the user clicks a button, that click too is an event. Other examples include events like pressing any key, closing a window, resizing a window, etc.

5 What is a string?
>>string is a primitive datatype in javascript or we can say that string is a sequence of one or more characters that may consist of letters, numbers, or symbols

6 What is an array? Is it static or dynamic in Javascript?

>>

7 Difference between Map and Set?
>>

8 Difference between Array and Map?
>>

9 What are array methods? List a few names?
>>arry methods are function actully built in function in javascript we can use them on our array
>> Each method has a unique function that performs a change or calculation to our array and saves us from writing common functions from scratch.
>> 1 .map();
>> 2 .sort();
>> 3 .reverse();
>> 4 .foreach();

10 In how many ways can we traverse through an array in Javascript?
>>

# programs

1 Reverse an array? Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

```
let arr= [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
arr.reverse();
console.log(arr);

```

2 Explain the properties of the join array method function via program?

```
```

3 Show all the values of an array in a html webpage using DOM and forEach method?
```
```
4 Merge to sets in javascript? (hint use Set class in javascript)
```
```
